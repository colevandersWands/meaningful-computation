/* meaningful computation
  when your computation space behaves like your problem space
    remember well-ordering of strings & numbers?
      well, you can do some maths in strings and it maps back!
  we'll revisit this concept again in Solution Design

the tricky bits now become
    finding the other set that behaves similarly
    mapping to that set
    and mapping back without losing info
