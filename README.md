# Meaningful Computation

So why does all this matter?  The true power of computers doesn't lie in how fast they can flip bits, it lies in our ability to model (or map) problems from the real world into bits. Computers then solve those problems very quickly, and we map the solution back into real-world actions.

It's often hidden behind layers of framework and hype, but the real job of a developer is to model a real-world domain in code to make real-world problems simpler to deal with. 
* Need to get somewhere but you're lost?  Google maps stores a representation of your location, your destination, and the best path as application data.  It displays the data on the screen for you in an intuitive way, and you act on what you see to get yourself where you need to be.
* Need to keep a daily todo list?  The classic todo app will model your tasks as application data and allow you to interact with the data in a way that mirrors real-world actions.  You've actually cleaned your room? mark it done in your todo list and it will store an updated representation of the world!

All this sounds pretty challenging, that's true.  This is one of the core skills of application design, it will take a lot of work to get good at this.  Over the course of this course you will get plenty of practice modeling real-world domains in your weekly projects.  For today we're keeping it simple.

The set of exercises here will get you used to cycle (map -> solve -> demap) with a few simple programming challenges.
